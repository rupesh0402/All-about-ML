# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails) , each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all features) and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.
