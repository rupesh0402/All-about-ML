# Multi-variate Regression

Multivariate regression is a technique used to measure the degree to which the various independent variable and various dependent variables are linearly related to each other. The relation is said to be linear due to the correlation between the variables. Once the multivariate regression is applied to the dataset, this method is then used to predict the behaviour of the response variable based on its corresponding predictor variables. 

Multivariate regression is commonly used as a supervised algorithm in machine learning, a model to predict the behaviour of dependent variables and multiple independent variables.
