# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is an example of supervised learning. It is used to calculate or predict the probability of a binary (yes/no) event occurring. An example of logistic regression could be applying machine learning to determine if a person is likely to be infected with COVID-19 or not. Since we have two possible outcomes to this question - yes they are infected, or no they are not infected - this is called binary classification.

In this imaginary example, the probability of a person being infected with COVID-19 could be based on the viral load and the symptoms and the presence of antibodies, etc. Viral load, symptoms, and antibodies would be our factors (Independent Variables), which would influence our outcome (Dependent Variable).
